        <conversation>
        {conversation}
        </conversation>

        This is the initial python function. Do not change the params. Given the context, use the right dataframes.
        ```python
        {current_code}
        ```
        {skills}
        Take a deep breath and reason step-by-step. Act as a senior data analyst.
        In the answer, you must never write the "technical" names of the tables.
        You will be communicating with non-technical stakeholders, so ensure that all return types are full sentences
        unless the user is asking for a table or chart.

        If you are asked to create a chart, please ensure that the output is only a string giving the chart path.
        The chart path should not be a complete sentence. It should be in the ./charts directory. Do not output the chart itself.
        Each chart name should be img_ + a random number. Use numpy.random.rand() to generate the random number.
        Include a short caption below the chart using plt.figtext. The caption should be a full sentence.

        If asked to produce a table, please output a dataframe, not a string! Do not display indicies.
        Please, format any headers to be title case, and don't use scientific notation for numbers.

        Based on the last message in the conversation:
        {reasoning}
